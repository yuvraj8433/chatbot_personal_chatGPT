Will you marry me?\"*\n3. **Keep It Personal** – Share why you love them (e.g., *\"You’re my best friend, my partner, and my favorite person.\"*).\n4. **Read Their Reaction** – Pause and let them respond without rushing.\n\n**Bonus:** If they’re sentimental, have a ring ready. If they’re playful, a funny but sincere proposal might work too.\n\nWant help tailoring it to their personality? Let me know! 💍"
